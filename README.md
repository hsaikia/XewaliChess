# XewaliChess
Xewali is a Chess Engine which uses MCTS and (currently) a static evaluation function. I hope to improve the program to use a neural network and learn the evaluation function using deep reinforcement learning. The move generation code is from the Stockfish repository : https://github.com/daylen/stockfish-mac/tree/master/Chess
